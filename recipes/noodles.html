        <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package fettuccine noodles</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>   
            <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.            </li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
